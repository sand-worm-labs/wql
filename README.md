# WQL

Sand Worm SQL Core


## Acknowledgments  

WQL is inspired by the incredible work of **[GlueSQL](https://github.com/gluesql/gluesql)** and **[EQL (EVM Query Language)](https://github.com/the-graph/eql)**. ðŸš€  

- **GlueSQL** provided a strong foundation for SQL parsing and execution in Rust. A huge shoutout to the GlueSQL team for their work on building a powerful and flexible SQL engine!  
- **EQL** inspired our approach to **querying blockchain data** with a SQL-like syntax, making on-chain data access more intuitive and efficient.  

While WQL has its own unique vision, these projects played a key role in shaping its development. If you're interested in embedded SQL databases or blockchain querying, we highly recommend checking them out!
